# FIT VUT Regex Analyzer

## About
I was bored and pissed off that automatic tests will grade our syntax and so on, so I decided to replicate their (university's) syntax checker using **regex** and **Python**. (Don't ask me why regex, it just felt right.)

## Features
- üîç **Syntax checking**: Checks if your code doesn't have anything bad(FIT VUT opinion)
- üé® **Color and no color mode**: Run with fancy colors or not(My classmate had problems with colors in terminal, so i decided to make no color flag)

## Setup

## For Windows:

### Install Chocolatey (if not already installed):

```
